I am Iliass TAHIRI, PhD student at Ecole des Ponts Paristech, specializing in materials science. Before beginning this adventure, I studied civil engineering in [Mohammadia School of Engineers](http://emi.um5.ac.ma/) (EMI) in Rabat, Morocco (graduating in 2014). After graduation, I worked as civil engineer in "[Direction des Aménagements Hydrauliques](http://www.water.gov.ma/) (DAH)" in Rabat. My work focus was on developing and designing dams. My interest in learning pushed me to pursue a Master degree at Ecole des Ponts-Paristech called ["Materiels Science for sustainable construction"](http://www.enpc.fr/en/masters-material-science-sustainaible-construction). In course of the Masters, I worked for 6 months at Laboratoire Navier and Institut of Geophysics in Novosibirsk (Russia) on my master thesis titled : ["Estimation of deformation and filtration properties of coal by adsorption test data based on inverse problem solution."](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/9780784480779.034).
After that (January 2017) I joined "Structure & Réhabilitation", a company specialized in underground constructions. My missions were solving problems related to the rehabilitation of old underground structures in the Paris area using numerical models (Soil-structure interaction, Reinforced concrete,...).

I am also interested in science, philosophy and mathematics and very enthusiastic about learning data science and machine learning ([Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/tiliass)). Programming is of great interest to me, I mainly use Python.
