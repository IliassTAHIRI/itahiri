Can we use machine learning to predict concrete properties such as 28-days resistance?

<!--more-->

Concrete 28-day resistance is a very important characteristic of concrete, it allow engineers, decision makers and constructers to assess the effectiveness and the conformity of the concrete vis a vis to norms.

For every machine learning problem we need data that we can train our model on.
