Diffusion properties of coal matrix

Introduction

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is an important greenhouse gas and is a major contributor to global warming. It is also produced as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion. Due to its large-scale storage potential, CO 2 sequestration has been widely investigated as a viable method for reducing the atmospheric concentration of this gas. However, there are few studies on diffusion properties under these conditions or even in pure CO 2 environments such as coal matrixes or other types of rock formations that may be used for long term storage of CO 2 . The objective of this study was to determine diffusion coefficients for pure CO 2 through bituminous coal using two different methods: steady state and dynamic equilibrium measurements over time periods that varied from minutes up to days.

Carbon dioxide uptake of a bituminous coal was measured by a manometric method.

A manometric method is a technique used to measure gas pressure. In the case of CO2 uptake, the change in pressure within a sample under vacuum is measured as it equilibrates with CO2-free air and then again as it equilibrates with room-temperature air containing 0.5% CO2. This process can be repeated until equilibrium is achieved or for a specified period of time. The amount of CO2 that has been taken up by the sample can then be calculated based on its initial composition and temperature, along with other measurements such as mass loss due to evaporation or desorption from the surface of each piece during exposure (if relevant).

Pure CO2 was used as the testing gas and its diffusion coefficient in the coal matrix was determined by a steady state measurement.

The diffusion coefficients of CO2 in the pure coal matrix at room temperature were determined by a steady-state measurement using pure CO2 and an initial concentration of 1%. The equilibrium concentrations of CO2 and methane in this study are 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.

The parameters investigated are room temperature, initial CO2 concentration, and relative humidity.

The parameters investigated are room temperature, initial CO2 concentration, and relative humidity. A major focus of this experiment was to find out the extent to which adsorbed water plays a role in CO2 uptake. The diffusion coefficient of CO2 through coal matrix was found using the method of linear extrapolation. Diffusion coefficients were also calculated for different conditions including presence or absence of adsorbed water on coal matrix and at different temperatures (room temperature).

Additionally, we determined the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by measuring its concentration changes over time in sealed bottles filled with coal samples exposed to different conditions like initial CO2 concentration and relative humidity etc.

Moreover, the effect of adsorbed water was determined by measuring CO2 uptake from an equilibrium mixture of dry air and N2.

The effect of adsorbed water on CO2 uptake was determined by measuring CO2 uptake from an equilibrium mixture of dry air and N2. This procedure is described in [4]. The amount of adsorbed water present in the coal matrix can be estimated using Equations 1 and 2 using the data obtained from these experiments.

The diffusion coefficients are found to be dependent on the initial CO2 concentrations and the adsorbed water amount.

It is well known that the diffusion coefficient of CO2 into coal matrixes depends on a number of factors including initial CO2 concentration, adsorbed water amount and relative humidity. In this study, we have investigated the effect of adsorbed water amount on the diffusive properties of coal matrixes. Our results show that the diffusion coefficients (D) are higher for dry coal matrixes than wet ones at low relative humidities (RH). For high RHs however, D values decrease with increasing RH values as more adsorbed water molecules are available for gas transfer.

It is also found that the effect of adsorbed water is dependent on relative humidity.

It is also found that the effect of adsorbed water is dependent on relative humidity. For example, at 20% RH and 30% CO2 concentration in air, the diffusivity of coal matrix was found to decrease with increasing temperature while at 60% RH and 30% CO2 concentration in air, it increased with increasing temperature. This suggests that there are two distinct mechanisms operating when water is adsorbed onto coal matrix: one mechanism which favours gas diffusion and another one which blocks it.

The diffusion properties of carbon dioxide in coal matrixes under sequestration conditions were found to be dependent on several physio-chemical parameters such as initial CO2 concentration, relative humidity and presence of adsorbed water.

The CO2 diffusion coefficient depends on the initial CO2 concentration

The CO2 diffusion coefficient depends on the adsorbed water amount

The CO2 diffusion coefficient depends on the relative humidity

The CO2 diffusion coefficient depends on the temperature

The CO2 diffusion coefficient depends on the pressure

Conclusion

The results show that the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in coal matrixes is dependent on several physio-chemical parameters. This can have significant implications for carbon dioxide sequestration studies, since it affects the rate at which gas diffuses into the sequestration media. For example, if a CO2 injection well experiences a decrease in pressure due to an earthquake or some other event, there could be an increased amount of diffusion into surrounding rock formations outside of the well's boundaries

My Work:

Enhanced coalbed methane is a technique used to improve the recovery of methane (CH4) from coalbeds. It consists in the injection of a fluid (CO2 ,N2) in a well and recover CH4 in an other well.

However, the injection of CO2 affect the swelling properties of coal due to the adsorption process. The swelling also affect the permeability of coal, that is considered one of the most important parameters in reservoir simulations. The aim of my master thesis is to determine by inverse calculation the permeability of a coal matrix using existing experimental data. The approach consists first in solving the direct problem of flow and swelling of coal matrix using a mixes approach of numerical and analytical resolution. Second, the inverse analysis consists in minimizing the chosen cost function in order to calculate the unknown parameters.

### Direct problem of flow and swelling of coal matrix

To derive the governing equation for flow of gas in the coal matrix, the mass conservation equation, Darcyâ€™s law and the equation of state of the fluid are combined. The resulting equation governs the CO2 flow process in coal matrix with the pressure p as a primary variable.

$$
\frac{\partial v*p}{\partial t}=D \nabla \cdot  (p(\nabla p) )$$


with $$ D=\frac{k}{RTn_0 \eta}   \text{and}  v=\frac{1}{p+p_0}$$
