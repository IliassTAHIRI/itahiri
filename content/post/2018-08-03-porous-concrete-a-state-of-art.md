A state of the art : Pervious concrete

<!--more-->

This article contains a state of art of resistance of pervious concrete vis-a-vis of freeze-thaw loads. This article is motivated by the fact that in November 2018 I will begin a new challenge which is doing a PhD. My research project is **"Freeze-thaw resistance of porous concrete"**, this project is initiated by **Laboratoire NAVIER** et **Lafarge-Holcim**. The main aim of the research project is to understand the mechanisms involved in the process of damage that occurs when the pervious concrete is subject to freeze-thaw cycles. The main steps of this work :
- Understand the problem in hand;
- Undertake a thorough bibliographic study to asses the state of the art;
- Understand how damage occurs;
- Build a model that capture the mechanisms of damage in pervious concrete;
- Design experiments that can lead to a significant understanding of the physical phenomenas involved in the process.

## Pervious concrete composition : \
Composition : Single(mono)-sized aggregate, cement, binder, water, set retarder, viscosity modifier.
