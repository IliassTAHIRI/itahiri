Pervious concrete : Introduction

<!--more-->

This article contains a brief introduction about pervious concrete. This article is motivated by the fact that in November 2018 I will begin a new challenge which is doing a PhD. My research project is **"Freeze-thaw resistance of porous concrete"**, this project is initiated by **Laboratoire NAVIER** et **Lafarge-Holcim**. The main aim of the research project is to understand the mechanisms involved in the process of damage that occurs when the pervious concrete is subject to freeze-thaw cycles. The main steps of this work :\

- Understand the problem in hand;\\
- Undertake a thorough bibliographic study to asses the state of the art;\\
- Understand how damage occurs;\\
- Build a model that capture the mechanisms of damage in pervious concrete;\\
- Design experiments that can lead to a significant understanding of the physical phenomenas involved in the process.

#### A recurrent question : Why porous concrete ?
<!-- Not as many people think, the permeable concrete is an old civil engineering material. In fact, research on this matter seriously tens of years ago. B -->

- Drainage of water in case of flood\\
- limit the quantities of water in sewers\\
- lower the quantities of water treatment\\

#### Pervious concrete composition :
Composition : Single(mono)-sized aggregate, cement, binder, water, set retarder, viscosity modifier.\\
Single-sized aggregate : The secret behind obtaining a porous concrete is the fact that the size of aggregate is the same.\

#### Pervious concrete durability challenges

This very useful material is subject to several durability challenges,.
